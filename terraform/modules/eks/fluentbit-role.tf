# ==================================================================================
# FLUENTBIT LOGGING ROLE
# ==================================================================================
# This file creates an IAM role for FluentBit to send logs to CloudWatch.
# FluentBit is deployed manually via Helm (not as EKS addon) because the addon
# doesn't support Kubernetes 1.33+.
#
# SECURITY BENEFITS:
# âœ… Uses IRSA (IAM Roles for Service Accounts) - no long-lived credentials
# âœ… Scoped permissions - only CloudWatch logs access
# âœ… Namespace-based log groups for better organization
#
# USAGE PATTERN:
# 1. Terraform creates the IAM role with CloudWatch permissions
# 2. Helm deploys FluentBit with ServiceAccount annotated with role ARN
# 3. FluentBit automatically gets AWS credentials via IRSA
# 4. Logs are sent to namespace-based CloudWatch log groups
#
# ðŸ”— DEPENDENCIES:
# - Requires OIDC provider from oidc-provider.tf
# - This role trusts the centralized OIDC provider for authentication
# ==================================================================================

# ==================================================================================
# FLUENTBIT IAM ROLE
# ==================================================================================
# IAM role for FluentBit DaemonSet to send logs to CloudWatch
# Only created when CloudWatch logging is enabled
